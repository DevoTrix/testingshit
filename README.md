# Project Description
  Over the years, the Salton Sea in Riverside has shrunk, exposing a bed of toxic waste and pesticide-runoff to the atmosphere. As it dries, toxic dust is blown with the wind so researchers and nearby residents wish to monitor the local air quality. 

  Our goal for this project is to improve ease of access of air quality information provided by sensors in the Salton Sea area. We aim to make it easier to read data from the Quant-AQ API and provide an alert system for the status of air monitors.

  Our project is important because it will help residents better understand their local air quality, and find out if their air filters are effective or not. Our project will also provide tools to researchers so that they are to do their jobs more efficiently.
 
  We will rely on pre-existing air quality monitors installed in various residences around the Salton Sea for real-time data collection. Python serves as our primary tool to process and evaluate the data. Additionally, we sre using MongoDB for easy retrieval of data.
  We are constructing the website with Handlebars (HTML), CSS, and node.js (javascript).
