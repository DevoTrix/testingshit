# Project Description
  Over the years, the Salton Sea in Riverside has shrunk, exposing a bed of toxic waste and pesticide-runoff to the atmosphere. As it dries, toxic dust is blown with the wind so researchers and nearby residents wish to monitor the local air quality. 

What is the goal of this project?
  Our goal for this project is to improve ease of access of air quality information provided by sensors in the Salton Sea area. We aim to make it easier to read data from the Quant-AQ API and provide an alert system for the status of air monitors.

Why is your project important?
  Our project is important because it will help residents better understand their local air quality, and find out if their air filters are effective or not. Our project will also provide tools to researchers so that they are to do their jobs more efficiently.
 
What platforms or tools do you plan to use?
  We will rely on pre-existing air quality monitors installed in various residences around the Salton Sea for real-time data collection. Python will serve as our primary tool to process and evaluate the data. Additionally, we may use SQL databases for easy retrieval of data.
  We will be using HTML, CSS, and JS for the building of the website. We are also considering the integration of React.js and TypeScript for a more robust web design.
